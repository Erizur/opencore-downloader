Thanks for reading this!
This tool is unstable, on a really early beta, and was made in 3 hours. Any problems with the script can be asked in the issues page in the github.

Incase you are having errors because of some modules missing, install wget on python by using:

-pip install wget

WARNING: Don't delete the OCD-Downloads folder or the OpenCore or the Kexts folder, it will make the script malfunction!
